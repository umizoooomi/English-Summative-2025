                <h2>What Is Climate Change?</h2>
                <p>Climate change refers to long-term changes in Earth’s average weather patterns and global temperatures. While the terms “climate change” and “global warming” are often used interchangeably, they have different meanings. Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth’s average surface temperature, whereas climate change contains a broader range of changes, including shifting weather patterns and rising sea levels. In other words, global warming is one of the many components of climate change.<br><br>At the core of climate change is the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect is a natural process that causes certain gases in the Earth’s atmosphere to trap the Sun’s heat. This trapped heat warms the Earth’s surface and allows the Earth to house life. However, recent human activities, especially burning fossil fuels, have significantly increased the concentration of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. This has intensified the greenhouse effect, causing the planet to warm at a faster rate.</p>

            <img src="https://www.vayahealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Myth-Vs-Facts.webp" 
            style="max-width:500px;width:100%;border-radius:16px;box-shadow:0 4px 24px #0008;display:block;margin:20px auto 24px auto;">
            <div class="myths-facts">
                <p><b>Myth: </b>"Climate change has always existed so there is no reason to act now"</p>
                <p><b>Fact: </b>It is true that the Earth’s climate has gone through several natural fluctuations. However, for the past 10,000 years, or since the last ice age, the climate has been relatively stable, allowing human civilizations to develop and thrive. The fluctuations we see now are different. The planet is warming at an unprecedented rate due to human activity. Since the mid-1800s, the Earth’s average temperature has risen by about 1.2° Celsius or 2.2° Fahrenheit. In fact, the past 10 years have experienced some of the Earth’s warmest temperatures. Unlike natural climate cycles, this warming is accelerating at a rapid rate.</p><br>
                <p><b>Myth: </b>"A couple of degrees of warming is okay."</p>
                <p><b>Fact: </b>At first glance, an increase of 1 or 2 degrees Celsius may seem insignificant. However, in the context of climate change, even the smallest shifts bring grave consequences. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a difference of just 0.5° Celsius can dramatically affect ecosystems, sea levels, and human health. For instance, an average temperature rise of 2° Celsius, compared to 1.5° Celsius, would expose nearly 2 billion more people to dangerous, life-threatening heatwaves regularly.</p><br>
                <p><b>Myth: </b>"Scientists still do not know the cause of climate change"</p>
                <p><b>Fact: </b>While science constantly evolves, the evidence to prove climate change is real is clear and overwhelming. Scientists rely on facts and statistics, not opinions, yet the consensus is nearly universal. In fact, 97% of climate scientists claim that human activity is the primary driver of current climate change. Over 200 global scientific organizations support this conclusion.</p>

        <!-- Causes Section -->
        <section id="causes">
            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>Climate change is mainly driven by human activities. While Earth’s climate has naturally shifted over time, the speed and severity of the current changes are not caused by natural cycles. Instead, they are the direct consequences of human actions.</p>
            <img src="https://media.citizen.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/file-20190916-19030-1c91vdb.jpg "
            style="max-width:500px;width:100%;border-radius:16px;box-shadow:0 4px 24px #0008;display:block;margin:20px auto 24px auto;">
            <p><b>Modern Lifestyles: </b>Modern lifestyles depend heavily on processes that emit greenhouse gases. Things like generating electricity and powering vehicles require the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and natural gas. These activities release massive amounts of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is among the most prevalent human-produced greenhouse gasses and it can remain in the atmosphere for hundreds to thousands of years. In other words, it continues to trap heat long after it is emitted.</p>
            <p><b>Deforestation: </b>Another major contributor to climate change is deforestation. Plants naturally absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis which helps regulate the climate. However, when trees are cut down or burned for agriculture, logging, and development, the carbon dioxide levels cannot be regulated as much. An estimated 15 billion trees are cut down each year, greatly reducing the Earth’s ability to regulate carbon dioxide levels.</p>
            <p><b>Oil Development: </b>Even before fossil fuels are burned, they begin to impact the environment. For instance, oil extraction releases emissions as soon as the drilling process begins. Fossil fuels like coal and petroleum are major sources of methane. While methane is less abundant than carbon dioxide, it is over 28 times more effective at trapping heat, making it an especially more potent greenhouse gas.</p>
            <p><b>Waste Management: </b> About 2.12 billion tons of waste are produced globally each year. Of this, only 62% of it is collected and managed in proper facilities. The remaining 38% is either burned, dumped or improperly discarded. This mismanagement leads to serious consequences like air pollution and soil degradation. However, even when waste is disposed of correctly in landfills, the environmental impact remains significant. The decomposition of organic waste, such as food and paper, releases carbon dioxide and methane. These are two of the most potent greenhouse gases that contribute directly to climate change.</p>

        <!-- Effects Section -->
        <section id="effects">
            <h2>Effects</h2>
            <p>Climate change is already reshaping the Earth. One of the most noticeable effects is the rise in sea levels. This is caused by the melting of glaciers and polar ice caps. Because of this, coastal areas around the world are experiencing increased flooding and erosion. Cities like Miami and Jakarta regularly experience flooding during high tides, even when there is no rain. The warming of the ocean is also causing things like coral bleaching and the destruction of marine ecosystems. Due to the excess of absorbing carbon dioxide, the oceans are becoming more acidic, harming organisms like shellfish and coral reefs.</p>
            <p>As temperatures rise, animals and plants are being forced to migrate to other areas. Species that rely on cold environments, like polar bears and snow leopards are losing their homes and other animals are struggling to adapt to the constantly changing seasonal patterns. This has already caused various species to go extinct. An example of this is the rodent species Bramble Cay melomys. This was the first species that was observed to go extinct due to climate change.</p>
            <p>Climate change also brings serious issues to human health and safety. Heatwaves are becoming more common and intense. This leads to more cases of heatstroke, dehydration, and in more extreme cases, death. Warmer temperatures not only increase the spread of allergens but also worsen the air quality index, leading to higher rates of respiratory issues.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 40px; max-width: 1000px; text-align: center;">This advertisement was made in 2012 to encourage people to use electric vehicles. Although it does exaggerate the issue, it is still very effective. It uses pathos to appeal to the viewers' empathy. The polar bear's long journey evokes compassion and a sense of moral responsibility. Along with that, the advertisement is a metaphor, showing the environmental consequences of human activities. It also shows that greener choices, like driving an electric vehicle, can alleviate the damage done by climate change.</p>

        <!-- Solutions Section -->
        <section id="solutions">
            <h2>Solutions</h2>
            <p><b>Transitioning to Renewable Energy: </b>Fossil fuels are the biggest contributors to climate change. Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydropower, and geothermal produce little to no greenhouse gases. Switching to renewable energy not only reduces emissions but also improves air quality and creates more jobs in the growing green job sectors. Things like green roofs and solar panels can help buildings produce clean energy and use less of it.</p>
            <p><b>Transportation Alternatives: </b>Cars and airplanes are some of the biggest producers of carbon dioxide. Using buses, trains, bikes, and walking can significantly reduce emissions. Using electrical vehicles can also help the effort.</p>
            <p><b>Reduce Energy Consumption: </b>Adding insulation and using energy-efficient appliances can significantly reduce the amount of emissions produced. Unplugging electronics after use and line drying clothes can also reduce the amount of energy consumed. By doing this, you not only help the environment but also save money.</p>
            <p><b>Minimize Waste: </b>Reduce, reuse, repair, and recycle as much as possible. When you can, repair broken items instead of buying new ones and dispose of waste properly. Buying sustainable products can also minimize environmental impacts.</p>
